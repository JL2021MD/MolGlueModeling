CA of SER is the defined binding site atom.

Top 3 poses after eliminating the ones that apparently clash with the full protein. Only the pocket residues of CRBN were used in the docking.
18J-pose1: docked output 9 (docking rank 1)
18J-pose2: docked output 10 (docking rank 4 before eliminate)
18J-pose3: docked out 8 (docking rank 8 before eliminate)
